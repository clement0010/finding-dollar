              As young adults, we are all going through the transition to adulthood. Being able to
              manage our finances is the first step to adulting. ICM$ SG: Finding Dollar provides an
              opportunity for you to assess the financial position of different characters and
              provide your input to strategize their personal finance. We hope that you would gain a
              thing or two from this, to better manage your own finances in the future.

                  You will be given a list of characters and a preview of these characters. You may
                  then choose your favourite character. After selection, you will be given a full
                  character brief containing the Character Overview, Financial Goals, Investment
                  Profile, Monthly Breakdown and Scenarios of your character. You are then required
                  to help your character to strategise an allocation plan to achieve the financial
                  goals. In addition, you will need to make sure that your character is managing the
                  finances carefully before making any financial decisions. Present your ideas and
                  strategy with the slide template provided.

                  <br />
                  Based on your selection, you will help your character strategise a solution to the
                  financial issue faced. You will communicate with the character role-played by the
                  judges and try to persuade them to reach your desired outcome. Do note that the
                  outcome of the role-play will not affect your primary allocation task. This
                  role-play session will contribute 30% to your total score as a team. You are
                  encouraged to act in the best interest of your character.
