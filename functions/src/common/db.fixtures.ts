  biography: `We have a 24-year-old lad, Nemo Ong, a freelance designer who graduated from the
    National University of Skrrr (NUS). Graduating in the COVID age, Nemo, a Mechanical Engineering
    graduate, struggled to hunt for a relevant job. He then decided to join the gig economy as a
    freelance designer. From his research, he discovered that being a freelancer provides a pretty
    decent salary as a fresh graduate, albeit with inconsistent wages at times. Nemo always gets the
    same question from his relatives: why did he choose to be a freelance designer even though he
    studied mechanical engineering. This perhaps relates to the social stereotype of medical
    doctors, engineers and lawyers as prestigious occupations. But Nemo -- a man with vision — knows
    there is no one job superior to others, and a job that he is truly passionate about is the best
    job for him. The only reason he took up a degree in Mechanical Engineering is his parents’
    strong preference for the perceived income stability it provides. While the dutiful son did
    follow his parents’ advice, Nemo did not let go of his passion and took up a Minor in
    Communications and New Media. His genuine interest in the design vertical led him to thrive in
    his minor studies, extending even into his free time, where he taught himself the basics of user
    experience and user interface. Nemo is genuinely grateful for his current job and appreciates
    the opportunity to do what he loves. <br /><br />
    As an industry professional who graduated with MBA, Dory definitely has a certain extent of
    financial literacy. She’s taking home a total of SGD 5,000 excluding bonuses from the company.
    While she believes that savings are important, she feels like her current investment portfolio
    is sufficient to cover what she needs in the future, thus spending almost all her income on
    things that she wants. She has a habit of using mobile everywhere and having the latest phone
    possible. That leads to her having a fixed 24 months phone contract. She loves shopping for
    handbags and usually spends most of her income on the latest editions when her pay comes in
    every month. While she’s working overseas, she’ll have to pay for her own accommodation and that
    will reduce her total income to spend on her daily life. She likes to take private taxis to work
    in the morning because she prefers to wake up later. Her household expenses came from utility
    bills and maintenance equipment only as she doesn’t cook at home. As mentioned, she’s also
    currently on a student loan for both her degree and masters that she’s yet to pay back.
    <br /><br />
    Beyond work, Nemo enjoys spending time with his fiancee. The couple met in university when they
    joined a design competition. Having been with each other for five years, they are now in a
    stable relationship and both of them think it is the right time to settle down. They agreed that
    it is not the best time to tie the knot right now, with the uncertainties brought about by the
    pandemic. They plan to hold a wedding in three years. The couple loves the idea of having a
    beach honeymoon, either at Bali or one of the Maldives’ private resorts. They are planning to
    save up for that. A good estimation of the wedding in 2027, excluding the honeymoon plans, goes
    up to SGD 60,000. Nemo thinks it is an achievable goal for him to fork out SGD 900 every month
    for the next three years. He had his tertiary education funded through the ASEAN scholarship and
    managed to save a pool of SGD 10,000 with prize money and side hustles from prior years.
    Although his income varies across the months as a freelance designer, he can comfortably bag
    home SGD 4,000 every month using the past year as a reference. He has been spending a
    significant portion of his income to purchase the latest design software and hardware and plans
    to continue doing so to gain more new clients.`,

  scenario: `<strong>Conversation with Future in-laws</strong> <br /><br />
    Nemo’s future in-laws are respectable businessmen in the timepiece field and they request for
    the couple to hold a grand wedding, inviting 600 guests, including their clients and business
    partners. Nemo is required to calm his future in-laws. He wants to make sure the parents of his
    girlfriend, Bubbles, understand the rationale behind their decision of holding an intimate or a
    grand wedding. The expected outcome is to find the consensus without ruining the relationship
    between the couple and their parents. But before this, he wants to seek the opinion of Bubbles.
    After all, they are the ones getting married. If they were to hold a grand wedding, he wants to
    make sure that both he and his girlfriend are comfortable with their finances since the grand
    wedding can cost up to SGD 200,000. They would be more confident financially in having an
    intimate wedding, as the couple just started their career. If they had an extra budget, they
    were thinking of doing a honeymoon in Bali. However, Nemo does understand where his future
    in-laws are coming from.

    Action required: The aim of this conversation is to clear the air, convey their decision and
    explain why they decided that this is best for them and their family. He wants to make sure that
    his in-laws understand that the couple respects them and that they are trying to make a decision
    that they are confident with.`,

  biography: `You have stumbled across a 24-year-old fine young man -- Nigel Chang, a law
    graduate and now the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of his startup focusing on regulatory
    technology. Despite his young age, he graduated from the National Tiktok University (NTU) two
    years ago and jumped straight into the startup scene right after he graduated with his best
    friends. He was fortunate to receive a scholarship award from OSeeBeeSeeBank and did not have to
    pay a single cent for his tuition fees. <br /><br />
    While he does share a passion for law, he has always wanted to do something different from being
    a compliance attorney. Via an introduction from his peers, he started exploring possibilities to
    enhance the procedures consisting of endless paperwork in the law industry. His company launched
    a new initiative in the FinTech industry consisting of tools to provide anti-fraud and risk
    management services for digital transactions by tracking payment entities. The company’s
    creativity sparked the interests of clients and investors with a client base of more than 100
    and is currently in a Series A funding round.

    base of more than 100 and is currently in a Series A funding round.
    <br /><br />
    He has great aspirations for his startup. Thus, he prefers to re-invest the revenue back into
    his firm rather than drawing income for his personal use. Therefore, he only takes an annual
    income of SGD 60,000. Most of his expenses go to his new car loan. On top of that, he often
    spends on expensive meals with clients to impress them, even with the clients prioritising the
    company’s potential deliverables and returns. Upon two years of graduation, he has saved SGD
    30,000 in total without strict control over his monthly expenses.
    <br /><br />
    His current goal is to own a house valued at SGD 1,5000,000 in five years. Nigel would also love
    to have some form of an emergency fund to tackle the uncertainties of his startups. While he is
    convinced that he should not purchase the house in cash, he still needs to save up for the 10%
    downpayment, which is SGD 150,000 in five years. His biggest obstacle is the inability to save
    effectively. For this, he would need to ramp up his savings to at least SGD 1000 per month to
    finance the downpayment of the housing loan that he would be applying for to purchase his house.`,

  biography: `Over here, we have a smart-looking guy, Max Tee, who graduated from the National
    University of Skrrr in 2020 with a Computer Science (CS) degree. However, he was not on any
    scholarship, and he took a tuition loan valued at SGD 47,000 with The BS Bank during Year 2. He
    has to repay this loan with an interest rate of 5.25% p.a. <br /><br />
    With his dedication and passion in the Software Engineering field, he managed to land his first
    full-time job at Turtle Van as a Junior Software Engineer. This allows him to have an annual
    income of SGD 60,000 to survive in the city with the highest cost of living. He is currently
    staying in a private housing flat with three other friends paying a monthly rent of SGD 1,200
    and sharing the utility cost with his friends. Even though his accommodation slightly exceeded
    his budget, its location is 10 minutes walk away from his office.
    <br /><br />
    It is time to talk about Max Tee’s spending habits. As a tech enthusiast himself, he spends most
    of his money buying “new toys” such as drones, the latest PC hardware and innovative home
    products. It was not surprising to hear that he recently purchased a new VR headset valued at
    SGD 400. As you can see, Max Tee is also a big supporter of cryptocurrency as he firmly believes
    it is the future of banking and finance. He previously invested SGD 5,000 in NemoCoin, but
    decided to hold it after it dropped to SGD 3,000. Max Tee prefers eating out instead of cooking
    his meal as he lacks cooking skills and does not want to spend time cooking. He would rather eat
    out at the nearby restaurant, which costs him about SGD 6 to 8 per meal. (Note: He does not like
    the nearby hawker stall simply because it does not taste good.)
    <br /><br />
    Being the eldest son in the family, Max Tee has to send money back to his home country to
    support his younger brother’s education cost to lift some financial burdens off his parents’
    shoulders. He also deposits SGD 300 as savings per month for his bucket list -- a one (1) week
    trip to Europe in late 2023. At the end of the month, he sometimes forgets to save enough money
    for this. With SGD 6,000 in his bank savings account, he is now SGD 9,000 away from his target
    and he has no other savings plan. `,

    pursued a Master of Business Administration (MBA) after completing her degree in Salty
    Management University. After graduation, she stood a chance to join a management associate
    program and was eventually converted for a full-time opportunity. She understood the value of
    education well and was willing to take up student loans to complete her MBA. She is currently
    working in Singapore and was unable to return to Malaysia due to the pandemic. Dory’s passion
    lies in the banking industry. The reason for this is that she has always wanted to do something
    related to numbers and at the same time have networking opportunities with professionals. With
    her outstanding co-curricular activities, coupled with her leadership capabilities, she was able
    to pass through numerous rounds of interviews for banks. Eventually, she landed her first job in

    That being said, Dory still has a dream to possess a small condo for herself in five years. The

    This means that she will have to save up at least SGD 100,000 for the downpayment of 10% before
    she is ready to buy the condominium. Before that, she prefers to spend her income on a more
    luxurious apartment to ‘prepare’ for her future lifestyle. After some calculations based on the
    time value of money, she will have to save at least SGD 600 every month, but she is afraid that
    she will have to spend all of her savings to fill up in case of an emergency. `,
